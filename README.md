## Features Overview

### Basic Usage (Builder API)

Most users will only need the Builder API for simple communication:

- **TCP Client**: Connect to remote servers with automatic reconnection
- **TCP Server**: Accept multiple client connections with thread-safe operations  
- **Serial Communication**: Interface with serial devices and embedded systems
- **Event Handlers**: Set up callbacks for connection, data, and error events
- **Auto Management**: Optional automatic resource management and lifecycle control

**See [Quick Start Guide](docs/guides/QUICKSTART.md) and [Tutorials](docs/tutorials/) for more examples.**

### Advanced Usage (Configuration Management API)

For advanced users who need dynamic configuration:

- **Dynamic Configuration**: Runtime configuration management
- **File-based Settings**: Save and load configurations from files
- **Flexible Parameters**: Configure connection settings, retry intervals, and device parameters
- **Environment Adaptation**: Adjust settings based on deployment environment

**See [API Guide](docs/reference/API_GUIDE.md) and [Architecture](docs/architecture/) for advanced features.**

### Build Configuration

Choose the build configuration that fits your needs:

- **Minimal Build** (`UNILINK_ENABLE_CONFIG=OFF`): Only Builder API, smaller footprint
- **Full Build** (`UNILINK_ENABLE_CONFIG=ON`): Includes configuration management API

**See [Quick Start Guide](docs/guides/QUICKSTART.md) for build instructions.**

## How to Build

You can build the library with different configurations to optimize for your use case.

### Basic Build (Builder API only - recommended for most users)

```bash
# 1. Configure for minimal footprint (Builder API only)
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUNILINK_ENABLE_CONFIG=OFF

# 2. Build the targets
cmake --build build -j
```

### Full Build (includes Configuration Management API)

```bash
# 1. Configure with all features
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUNILINK_ENABLE_CONFIG=ON

# 2. Build the targets
cmake --build build -j
```
